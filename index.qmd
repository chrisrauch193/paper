# Drivers of Host Sea Anemone and Anemonefish Richness

This section replicates the initial data loading and processing steps from the desert ant paper's results section, adapted for the anemonefish-anemone mutualism. We load the current predicted suitability rasters for host sea anemones and anemonefish (environmental-only models), calculate community richness, and crop them to the Indo-Pacific study area.
